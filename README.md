# Mars Rover
### Summary
This is a project undertaken during the Northcoders Java Bootcamp. It is a simple execution of code to allow a semi autonomous robot to navigate the surface of a given area using only input from a computer.

### How to use
The code is currently without a user interface, but can be accessed and trialled using the IntegrationTest.java file. A terminal based UI is to be added. The programme takes input as follows:

#### Initiate Plateau
A string of two numbers, representing the maximum x and y axes, separated by a space.
#### Initiate Rover
A string of two numbers determining the starting coordinates of the rover, and an orientation of N, S, E or W to determine which way it starts off facing.
#### Move Rover
A string of instructions, no space separation, of either R for turn right 90 degrees, L for left, and M for move one unit in the direction currenltly faced.

### To run
This project has been built in intellij using maven, so i imagine you will have to have those both set up.
