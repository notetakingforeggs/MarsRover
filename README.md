## 🌌 About the Project

The Mars Rover Project is a simulation intended to mimic a program that could be used to control semi-autonomous robots on the surface of Mars. The application features a terminal-based user interface and is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly. By pressing "run", the program will guide you through the necessary steps to control the Mars Rover.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Java JDK 8 or higher
- Maven
- An IDE (preferably IntelliJ IDEA)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   
From this link: https://github.com/notetakingforeggs/MarsRover
   
2.  **Open the project in your preferred IDE**

Open the cloned repository in IntelliJ IDEA or any other code editor of your choice.

3.  **Build the project using Maven**

In IntelliJ IDEA, the project should automatically import Maven dependencies. 

## 🎮 Usage

After setting up the project, simply run the main class. The program will start in your terminal, and you can begin interacting with your Mars Rover simulation.

1. **Run the application**

   In IntelliJ IDEA, right-click the `Main` class and select `Run 'Main'`.

2. **Follow the on-screen instructions**

   The terminal interface will guide you through the process of controlling the Mars Rover.
